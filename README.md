# Hi 👋, I'm Kris Mao

🎓 Computer Science graduate and current **Master of Data Science** student at the University of Auckland  
🤖 Python-first **Applied AI / Data Developer** focused on real-world operational and safety problems  

I’m particularly interested in building **practical, responsible AI systems** — not just models in notebooks, but AI tools that can be safely integrated into real workflows.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### Applied AI System for Controlled Automation (Master’s Project)
- Designed and implemented a **Python-based AI system** integrating large language models into operational workflows.
- Built validation layers and execution guardrails to ensure **predictable, auditable, and safe AI behaviour**.
- Focused on **system-level reliability**, data preprocessing, and integration rather than standalone model performance.
- Explored how the system could be adapted to **operational and safety-critical environments**.
